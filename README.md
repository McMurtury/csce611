# CSCE 611
**Author: Mark Daniel McMurtury and Cody Bulter**

This was for our class CSCE 611 Advance Digital Logic during the fall of 2019. We were working in system verilog to program a programmable circuit board, FPGA. The most challagening labs were the last two, the third lab was a RPN calculator that used a stack data structure for memory. The last lab was creating a CPU that would read in assembly code that was converted into hexadecimal. This was three stage cpu, with one cycle to fetch the instruction, a second cycle to decode and execute the instruction, and a final cycle to push back the results.
